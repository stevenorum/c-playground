# c-playground

## Purpose
This is a collection of little snippets I've gathered that explain or demonstrate different pieces of using C that I'm likely to forget and need refreshed.  It may also be useful for other people to learn basic stuff.

## Sections
0. [general_intro](general_intro): Mostly contains notes about the terminology and whatnot.  Mostly for people who aren't me.
1. [makefiles_intro](makefiles_intro/): Introduction to basic Makefile stuff.
2. [really_basic_c](really_basic_c): Some really basic C stuff.

## Acknowledgements

The following are a bunch of places from which I've grabbed sample code.  I'll also try to link to them in the borrowed code, as well.

### Big stuff

- [Colby College Makefile tutorial](http://www.cs.colby.edu/maxwell/courses/tutorials/maketutor/): This makes up the vast majority of the source for [makefiles_intro](makefiles_intro/)
